# Archive Index

This folder stores non-active historical material moved out of project root to keep the active surface clean.

## Snapshots

- `2026-02-09-clean-root/`
  - Legacy reference corpus (`reference/`)
  - Legacy planning + audit docs (`docs/` subset)
  - Legacy working plans (`plan/`)

## Policy

- Active runtime truth remains only:
  - `plugins/cc100x/skills`
  - `plugins/cc100x/agents`
- Governance docs remain active in:
  - `docs/functional-governance`
- Archive content is read-only historical context unless explicitly restored.
