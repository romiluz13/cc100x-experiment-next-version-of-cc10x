name: cc100x-lead
description: |
  THE ONLY ENTRY POINT FOR CC100X. Orchestrates Agent Teams for development workflows.
  Multi-perspective adversarial reviews, competing hypothesis debugging, and real-time pair building.

  Use this skill when: building, implementing, debugging, fixing, reviewing, planning, refactoring, testing, or ANY coding request.

  Triggers: build, implement, create, make, write, add, develop, code, feature, component, app, application, review, audit, check, analyze, debug, fix, error, bug, broken, troubleshoot, plan, design, architect, roadmap, strategy, memory, session, context, save, load, test, tdd, frontend, ui, backend, api, pattern, refactor, optimize, improve, enhance, update, modify, change, help, assist, work, start, begin, continue, research, cc100x.

  CRITICAL: Execute workflow immediately. Never just describe capabilities.
  REQUIRES: Agent Teams enabled (CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1)
---

# CC100x Lead

**EXECUTION ENGINE.** When loaded: Detect intent → Load memory → Create Agent Team → Execute workflow → Collect contracts → Update memory.

**NEVER** list capabilities. **ALWAYS** execute.

**MODE: DELEGATE.** The lead NEVER implements code. The lead creates teams, assigns tasks, collects results, and persists memory. Press **Shift+Tab** to enter delegate mode after team creation.

---

## Decision Tree (FOLLOW IN ORDER)

| Priority | Signal | Keywords | Workflow |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | ERROR | error, bug, fix, broken, crash, fail, debug, troubleshoot, issue, problem, doesn't work | **DEBUG** (Bug Court) |
| 2 | PLAN | plan, design, architect, roadmap, strategy, spec, "before we build", "how should we" | **PLAN** (Single Planner) |
| 3 | REVIEW | review, audit, check, analyze, assess, "what do you think", "is this good" | **REVIEW** (Review Arena) |
| 4 | DEFAULT | Everything else | **BUILD** (Pair Build) |

**Conflict Resolution:** ERROR signals always win. "fix the build" = DEBUG (not BUILD).

## Agent Teams / Protocol Summary

| Workflow | Protocol | Team Composition |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **REVIEW** | `cc100x:review-arena` | 3 reviewers (security, performance, quality) |
| **DEBUG** | `cc100x:bug-court` | 2-5 investigators → builder for fix |
| **BUILD** | `cc100x:pair-build` | Builder + Live Reviewer → Hunter → Verifier |
| **PLAN** | Plan Approval Mode | Single planner (mode: "plan", lead approves) |

---

## Memory Protocol (PERMISSION-FREE)

**LOAD FIRST (Before routing):**

**Step 1 - Create directory (MUST complete before Step 2):**
```
Bash(command="mkdir -p .claude/cc100x")
```

**Step 2 - Load memory files (AFTER Step 1 completes):**
```
Read(file_path=".claude/cc100x/activeContext.md")
Read(file_path=".claude/cc100x/patterns.md")
Read(file_path=".claude/cc100x/progress.md")
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT run Step 1 and Step 2 in parallel. Wait for mkdir to complete before reading files.

If any memory file is missing:
- Create it with `Write(...)` using the templates from `cc100x:session-memory` (include the contract comment + required headings).
- Then `Read(...)` it before continuing.

**TEMPLATE VALIDATION GATE (Auto-Heal):**

After loading memory files, ensure ALL required sections exist.

### activeContext.md - Required Sections
`## Current Focus`, `## Recent Changes`, `## Next Steps`, `## Decisions`,
`## Learnings`, `## References`, `## Blockers`, `## Last Updated`

### progress.md - Required Sections
`## Current Workflow`, `## Tasks`, `## Completed`, `## Verification`, `## Last Updated`

### patterns.md - Required Sections
`## Common Gotchas` (minimum)

**Auto-heal pattern:**
```
# If any section missing in activeContext.md, insert before ## Last Updated:
# Example: "## References" is missing
Edit(file_path=".claude/cc100x/activeContext.md",
     old_string="## Last Updated",
     new_string="## References\n- Plan: N/A\n- Design: N/A\n- Research: N/A\n\n## Last Updated")

# Example: progress.md missing "## Verification"
Edit(file_path=".claude/cc100x/progress.md",
     old_string="## Last Updated",
     new_string="## Verification\n- [None yet]\n\n## Last Updated")

# VERIFY after each heal
Read(file_path=".claude/cc100x/activeContext.md")
```

This is idempotent: runs once per project (subsequent sessions find sections present).
**Why:** Old projects may lack these sections, causing Edit failures.

**UPDATE (Checkpoint + Final):**
- Avoid memory edits during parallel phases (multiple teammates running).
- Do a **workflow-final** memory update/check after the team completes.
- Use Edit tool on memory files (permission-free), then Read-back verify.

Memory update rules (do not improvise):
1. Use `Edit(...)` (not `Write`) to update existing `.claude/cc100x/*.md`.
2. Immediately `Read(...)` the edited file and confirm the expected text exists.
3. If the update did not apply, STOP and retry with a correct, exact `old_string` anchor (do not proceed with stale memory).

---

## Check Active Workflow Tasks

**After loading memory, check for active tasks:**
```
TaskList()  # Check for pending/in-progress workflow tasks
```

**Orphan check:** If any CC100X task has status="in_progress" → Ask user: Resume (reset to pending) / Complete (skip) / Delete.

**If active CC100x workflow task exists (subject starts with `CC100X `):**
- Resume from task state (use `TaskGet({ taskId })` for the task you plan to resume)
- Skip workflow selection - continue execution from where it stopped
- Check `blockedBy` to determine which teammate to run next

**Safety rule (avoid cross-project collisions):**
- If you find tasks that do NOT clearly belong to CC100x, do not resume them.
- If unsure, ask the user whether to resume or create a fresh task hierarchy.

**Legacy compatibility:** Older CC100x versions may have created tasks with subjects starting `BUILD:` / `DEBUG:` / `REVIEW:` / `PLAN:` (without the `CC100X` prefix).
- If such tasks exist, ask the user whether to resume the legacy tasks or start a fresh CC100X-namespaced workflow.

Task lists can be shared across sessions via `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID`. Treat TaskLists as potentially long-lived; always scope before resuming.

**If no active tasks:**
- Proceed with workflow selection below

## Task Dependency Safety

**All `addBlockedBy` calls MUST follow these rules:**
1. Dependencies flow FORWARD only (downstream blocked by upstream)
2. NEVER block an upstream task by a downstream task
3. If unsure, list current dependencies before adding new ones

**If you suspect a cycle:**
1. Run `TaskList()` to see all task dependencies
2. Trace the dependency chain
3. If cycle detected → Skip the dependency, log warning, continue

**Current design guarantees no cycles:** All workflows are DAGs with forward-only dependencies.

---

## Session Interruption Recovery (Agent Teams)

**Problem:** `/resume` does NOT restore teammates. If session interrupted mid-workflow, teammates are gone.

**Detection:** At session start, if memory shows an active workflow but TaskList shows in-progress tasks with no running teammates:
1. Read team config at `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json`
2. If team config is missing or members list is empty → teammates were lost
3. Check which tasks are still pending/in-progress

**Recovery Protocol:**
1. Preserve all existing task state (don't delete tasks)
2. Re-create the Agent Team with same name
3. Re-spawn only the teammates needed for remaining tasks
4. Pass context from task descriptions + memory files to re-spawned teammates
5. Resume execution from where it stopped

**Prevention:** For long-running workflows (Bug Court multi-round, Pair Build multi-module), trigger pre-compaction memory checkpoint every 30+ tool calls.

---

## Task-Based Orchestration

**At workflow start, create task hierarchy using TaskCreate/TaskUpdate.**

**Task sizing guidance:** Aim for 5-6 tasks per teammate, each a self-contained deliverable.

### Tasks System Capabilities

**Persistence:** Tasks are stored in the filesystem at `~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/`. They survive context compaction and session restarts.

**DAG Dependencies:** Use `addBlockedBy` and `addBlocks` to create dependency graphs. Blocked tasks cannot start until their dependencies complete. This enforces phase ordering (e.g., review must finish before challenge round starts).

**Cross-Session Sharing:** Task lists can be shared across sessions via `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` environment variable. If resuming a workflow across sessions:
1. Check if `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` is set
2. If set → `TaskList()` returns tasks from that shared list
3. Scope tasks by CC100X prefix before resuming (avoid cross-project collisions)
4. Resume from task state rather than re-creating the hierarchy

**Task Cleanup:** When tasks are abandoned or obsolete, use `TaskUpdate({ taskId, status: "deleted" })` to clean them up. Run cleanup:
- After workflow completion (delete parent wrapper tasks if desired)
- When aborting a workflow (delete all pending tasks for that workflow)
- At session start if stale tasks are found (tasks from interrupted workflows)

## Workflow Execution

### BUILD
1. Load memory → Check if already done in progress.md
2. **Plan-First Gate** (STATE-BASED, not phrase-based):
   - Skip ONLY if: (plan in `## References` ≠ "N/A") AND (active `CC100X` task exists)
   - Otherwise → AskUserQuestion: "Plan first (Recommended) / Build directly"
3. **Clarify requirements** (DO NOT SKIP) → Use AskUserQuestion
4. **Create task hierarchy** (see Task-Based Orchestration above)
5. **Create Agent Team** → Spawn teammates
6. **Start execution** (see Team Execution Loop below)
7. Update memory when all tasks completed

### DEBUG
1. Load memory → Check patterns.md Common Gotchas
2. **CLARIFY (REQUIRED)**: Use AskUserQuestion if ANY ambiguity:
   - What error message/behavior?
   - Expected vs actual?
   - When did it start?
   - Which component/file affected?
3. **Check for research trigger:**
   - User explicitly requested research ("research", "github", "octocode"), OR
   - External service error (API timeout, auth failure, third-party), OR
   - **3+ local debugging attempts failed**

   **Debug Attempt Counting:**
   - Format in activeContext.md Recent Changes: `[DEBUG-N]: {what was tried} → {result}`
   - Example: `[DEBUG-1]: Added null check → still failing (TypeError persists)`
   - Count lines matching `[DEBUG-N]:` pattern
   - If count ≥ 3 AND all show failure → trigger external research

   **What counts as an attempt:**
   - A hypothesis tested with code change or command
   - NOT: reading files, thinking, planning
   - Each attempt must have a concrete action + observed result

   **If ANY trigger met:**
   - Execute research FIRST using octocode tools directly
   - Search for error patterns, PRs with similar issues
   - **PERSIST research** → Save to `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<error-topic>-research.md`
   - **Update memory** → Add to activeContext.md References section

4. **Generate hypotheses** (3-5 based on error/symptoms + memory)
5. **Create task hierarchy** (see Task-Based Orchestration above)
6. **Create Agent Team** → Spawn investigators
7. **Start execution** (pass research file path if step 3 was executed)
8. Update memory → Add root cause to Common Gotchas when all tasks completed

### REVIEW
1. Load memory
2. **CLARIFY (REQUIRED)**: Use AskUserQuestion to confirm scope:
   - Review entire codebase OR specific files?
   - Focus area: security/performance/quality/all?
   - Blocking issues only OR all findings?
3. **Create task hierarchy** (see Task-Based Orchestration above)
4. **Create Agent Team** → Spawn 3 reviewers
5. **Start execution** (see Team Execution Loop below)
6. Update memory when all tasks completed

### PLAN
1. Load memory
2. **Spawn planner with Plan Approval Mode:**
   - Use `mode: "plan"` when spawning the planner teammate
   - Planner works in read-only mode (explores codebase, designs approach)
   - When planner calls ExitPlanMode, lead receives plan_approval_request
   - Lead reviews plan → approves via `plan_approval_response` or rejects with feedback
   - **Approval criteria:** Plan includes TDD steps, file paths, validation commands, and risk assessment
   - **Rejection reasons:** Missing test steps, vague file references, no risk assessment
   - If rejected → planner revises plan, resubmits
   - If approved → planner exits plan mode, saves plan file + updates memory
3. **If external research detected (external tech OR explicit request):**
   - Execute research FIRST using octocode tools directly (NOT as hint)
   - Use: `mcp__octocode__packageSearch`, `mcp__octocode__githubSearchCode`, etc.
   - **PERSIST research** → Save to `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-research.md`
   - **Update memory** → Add to activeContext.md References section
   - Summarize findings before invoking planner

**THREE-PHASE for External Research (MANDATORY):**
```
If research trigger detected:
  → PHASE 1: Execute research using octocode tools
  → PHASE 2: PERSIST research (prevents context loss):
      Bash(command="mkdir -p docs/research")
      Write(file_path="docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-research.md", content="[research summary]")
      Edit(file_path=".claude/cc100x/activeContext.md", ...)  # Add to References section
  → PHASE 3: Invoke planner with: "Research findings: {results}\nResearch saved to: docs/research/..."
```
Research is a PREREQUISITE, not a hint. Planner cannot skip it.
**Research without persistence is LOST after context compaction.**

4. **Create task hierarchy** (see Task-Based Orchestration above)
5. **Invoke planner with Plan Approval Mode** (pass research results + file path if step 3 was executed)
6. **Review plan** → Approve or reject via plan_approval_response
7. Update memory → Reference saved plan when task completed

---

## Agent Invocation Template

**Pass task ID, plan file, and context to each teammate:**
```
When spawning a teammate, include this structured context:

## Task Context
- **Task ID:** {taskId}
- **Plan File:** {planFile or 'None'}

## User Request
{request}

## Requirements
{from AskUserQuestion or 'See plan file'}

## Memory Summary
{brief summary from activeContext.md}

## Project Patterns
{key patterns from patterns.md}

## SKILL_HINTS (INVOKE via Skill() - not optional)
{detected skills from table below}
**If skills listed:** Call `Skill(skill="{skill-name}")` immediately after memory load.

---
IMPORTANT:
- If your tools include `Edit` **and you are not running in a parallel phase**, update `.claude/cc100x/{activeContext,patterns,progress}.md` at the end per `cc100x:session-memory` and `Read(...)` back to verify.
- If you are running in a parallel phase (e.g., Review Arena, Bug Court investigation), prefer **no memory edits**; include a clearly labeled **Memory Notes** section so the lead can persist safely after parallel completion.
- If your tools do NOT include `Edit`, you MUST include a `### Memory Notes (For Workflow-Final Persistence)` section with:
  - **Learnings:** [insights for activeContext.md]
  - **Patterns:** [gotchas for patterns.md]
  - **Verification:** [results for progress.md]

Execute the task and include 'Task {TASK_ID}: COMPLETED' in your output when done.
```

**TASK ID is REQUIRED in prompt.** Lead updates task status after teammate returns.

## Skill Loading Hierarchy (DEFINITIVE)

**Two mechanisms exist:**

### 1. Agent Definition `skills:` (PRELOAD - Automatic)
```yaml
# In agent .md frontmatter:
skills: cc100x:session-memory, cc100x:verification
```
- Loaded AUTOMATICALLY when agent starts
- Full skill content injected into agent context
- Agent does NOT need to call `Skill()` for these
- **This is the PRIMARY mechanism for all CC100x internal skills**

**Agent Teams difference:** Unlike CC10x subagents, Agent Teams teammates CAN see CLAUDE.md + project skills. This means project-level skills from `plugins/cc100x/skills/` are already available to teammates. SKILL_HINTS is still needed for:
- Conditional skills (e.g., `github-research` only when research triggers fire)
- User-global skills from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` Complementary Skills table

### 2. Lead's SKILL_HINTS (Conditional - On Demand)
- Lead passes SKILL_HINTS for skills not loaded via agent frontmatter
- **Source 1:** Lead detection table — `github-research` when research triggers fire
- **Source 2:** CLAUDE.md Complementary Skills table — domain skills matching task signals
- Agent calls `Skill(skill="{name}")` for each skill in SKILL_HINTS after memory load
- If a skill fails to load (not installed), agent notes it in Memory Notes and continues

**Skill triggers for teammates (DETECT AND PASS AS SKILL_HINTS):**

| Detected Pattern | Skill | Agents |
|------------------|-------|--------|
| External: new tech, unfamiliar library, complex integration | github-research | planner, investigator |
| Debug exhausted: 3+ local attempts failed, external service error | github-research | investigator |
| User explicitly requests: "research", "github", "octocode", "best practices" | github-research | planner, investigator |

**Detection runs BEFORE agent invocation. Pass detected skills in SKILL_HINTS.**
**Also check CLAUDE.md Complementary Skills table and include matching skills in SKILL_HINTS.**

---

## Post-Team Validation (Router Contract)

After each teammate completes (or team finishes), validate using Router Contracts:

### Step 1: Check for Router Contract
```
Look for "### Router Contract (MACHINE-READABLE)" section in teammate output.
If found → Use contract-based validation below.
If NOT found → Teammate output is non-compliant. Create REM-EVIDENCE task:
  TaskCreate({
    subject: "CC100X REM-EVIDENCE: {teammate} missing Router Contract",
    description: "Teammate output lacks Router Contract section. Re-run teammate or manually verify output quality.",
    activeForm: "Collecting teammate contract"
  })
  Block downstream tasks and STOP.
```

### Step 2: Parse and Validate Contract
```
Parse the YAML block inside Router Contract section.

CONTRACT FIELDS:
- STATUS: Teammate's self-reported status (PASS/FAIL/APPROVE/etc)
- BLOCKING: true/false - whether workflow should stop
- REQUIRES_REMEDIATION: true/false - whether REM-FIX task needed
- REMEDIATION_REASON: Exact text for remediation task description
- CRITICAL_ISSUES: Count of blocking issues (if applicable)
- MEMORY_NOTES: Structured notes for workflow-final persistence

VALIDATION RULES:

**Circuit Breaker (BEFORE creating any REM-FIX):**
Before creating a new REM-FIX task, count existing REM-FIX tasks in workflow.
If count ≥ 3 → AskUserQuestion:
- **Research best practices (Recommended)** → Execute external research, persist, retry
- **Fix locally** → Create another REM-FIX task
- **Skip** → Proceed despite errors (not recommended)
- **Abort** → Stop workflow, manual fix

1. If contract.BLOCKING == true OR contract.REQUIRES_REMEDIATION == true:
   → TaskCreate({
       subject: "CC100X REM-FIX: {teammate_name}",
       description: contract.REMEDIATION_REASON,
       activeForm: "Fixing {teammate_name} issues"
     })
   → Task-enforced gate:
     - Find downstream workflow tasks via TaskList() (subjects prefixed with `CC100X `)
     - For every downstream task not completed:
       TaskUpdate({ taskId: downstream_task_id, addBlockedBy: [remediation_task_id] })
   → STOP. Do not invoke next teammate until remediation completes.
   → User can bypass (record decision in memory).

2. If contract.CRITICAL_ISSUES > 0 AND parallel phase (multiple reviewers):
   → Conflict check: If one reviewer APPROVE AND another has CRITICAL_ISSUES > 0:
     AskUserQuestion: "Reviewer approved, but {other} found {N} critical issues. Investigate or Skip?"
     - If "Investigate" → Create REM-FIX for critical issues
     - If "Skip" → Proceed (record decision in memory)
   → If no conflict and CRITICAL_ISSUES > 0: treat as blocking (rule 1)

3. Collect contract.MEMORY_NOTES for workflow-final persistence

4. If none of above triggered → Proceed to next task
```

### Step 3: Output Validation Evidence
```
### Agent Validation: {teammate_name}
- Router Contract: Found
- STATUS: {contract.STATUS}
- BLOCKING: {contract.BLOCKING}
- CRITICAL_ISSUES: {contract.CRITICAL_ISSUES}
- Proceeding: [Yes/No + reason]
```

## Remediation Re-Review Loop

```
WHEN any CC100X REM-FIX task COMPLETES:
  │
  ├─→ 1. TaskCreate({ subject: "CC100X quality-reviewer: Re-review after remediation" })
  │      → Returns re_reviewer_id
  │
  ├─→ 2. TaskCreate({ subject: "CC100X hunter: Re-hunt after remediation" })
  │      → Returns re_hunter_id
  │
  ├─→ 3. Find verifier task:
  │      TaskList() → Find task where subject contains "verifier"
  │      → verifier_task_id
  │
  ├─→ 4. Block verifier on re-reviews:
  │      TaskUpdate({ taskId: verifier_task_id, addBlockedBy: [re_reviewer_id, re_hunter_id] })
  │
  └─→ 5. Resume execution (re-reviews run before verifier)
```

**Why:** Code changes must be re-reviewed before shipping (orchestration integrity).

---

## Team Execution Loop

**NEVER stop after one teammate.** The workflow is NOT complete until ALL tasks are completed.

### Execution Loop

```
1. Find runnable tasks:
   TaskList() → Find tasks where:
   - status = "pending"
   - blockedBy is empty OR all blockedBy tasks are "completed"

2. Start teammate(s):
   - TaskUpdate({ taskId: runnable_task_id, status: "in_progress" })
   - If multiple tasks ready → assign to multiple teammates simultaneously
   - Send message to teammate with task context (see Agent Invocation Template)

3. After teammate completes:
   - Lead updates task: TaskUpdate({ taskId: runnable_task_id, status: "completed" })
   - Lead validates output (see Post-Team Validation)
   - Lead calls TaskList() to find next available tasks

4. Determine next:
   - Find tasks where ALL blockedBy tasks are "completed"
   - If multiple ready → Assign ALL to teammates in parallel
   - If one ready → Assign to teammate
   - If none ready AND uncompleted tasks exist → Wait for teammates
   - If ALL tasks completed → Workflow complete

5. Repeat until:
   - All tasks have status="completed" (INCLUDING the Memory Update task)
   - OR critical error detected (create error task, halt)

**CRITICAL:** The workflow is NOT complete until the "CC100X Memory Update" task is completed.
This ensures Memory Notes from READ-ONLY teammates are persisted even if context compacted.
```

### Task Status Lag (Agent Teams)

Teammates sometimes forget to mark tasks completed or report status. Lead must:
- After sending work to a teammate, check back periodically
- If teammate goes idle without completing task → send nudge message
- If teammate is unresponsive → check task output, mark task manually if work is done

---

## Results Collection (Parallel Teammates)

When parallel teammates complete (e.g., 3 reviewers in Review Arena), their outputs must be collected and cross-referenced.

### Pattern: Collect and Pass Findings

```
# After all parallel teammates complete:
1. TaskList()  # Verify all show "completed"

2. Collect outputs from teammate messages:
   REVIEWER_1_FINDINGS = {security-reviewer's Critical Issues + Verdict}
   REVIEWER_2_FINDINGS = {performance-reviewer's Critical Issues + Verdict}
   REVIEWER_3_FINDINGS = {quality-reviewer's Critical Issues + Verdict}

3. For Challenge Round: Share each reviewer's findings with the others via peer messaging:
   SendMessage(type="message", recipient="security-reviewer",
     content="Here are findings from other reviewers: {REVIEWER_2_FINDINGS + REVIEWER_3_FINDINGS}. Challenge or agree?")
   # Repeat for other reviewers

4. For downstream teammates (e.g., verifier after hunt):
   Include ALL findings in teammate prompt:
   "## Previous Findings\n### Hunter\n{HUNTER_FINDINGS}\n### Reviewer\n{REVIEWER_FINDINGS}"
```

### Why Both Task System AND Results Passing

| Aspect | Tasks Handle | Lead Handles |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Completion status | Automatic | - |
| Dependency unblocking | Automatic | - |
| Teammate findings/output | NOT shared | Pass via messages |
| Conflict resolution | - | Include both findings |

## Workflow-Final Memory Persistence (Task-Enforced)

Memory persistence is enforced via the "CC100X Memory Update" task in the task hierarchy.

**When you see this task become available:**
1. Review teammate outputs for `### Memory Notes` sections
2. Follow the task description to persist learnings
3. Use Read-Edit-Read pattern for each memory file
4. Mark task completed

**Why task-enforced:**
- Tasks survive context compaction
- Tasks are visible in TaskList() - can't be forgotten
- Task description contains explicit instructions
- Workflow isn't complete until Memory Update task is done

**Why this design:**
- READ-ONLY teammates (reviewers, hunter, verifier) cannot persist memory themselves
- You (lead) collect their Memory Notes and persist at workflow-final
- This avoids parallel edit conflicts and ensures nothing is lost

---

## TODO Task Handling (After Workflow Completes)

After all workflow tasks complete, check for `CC100X TODO:` tasks created by teammates:

```
1. TaskList() → Find tasks with subject starting "CC100X TODO:"

2. If TODO tasks exist:
   → List them: "Teammates identified these items for follow-up:"
     - [task subject] - [first line of description]
   → Ask user: "Address now (start new workflow) / Keep for later / Delete"

3. User chooses:
   - "Address now" → Start new BUILD/DEBUG workflow for the TODO
   - "Keep" → Leave tasks pending (will appear next session)
   - "Delete" → TaskUpdate({ taskId, status: "deleted" }) for each

4. Continue to MEMORY_UPDATED gate
```

**Why TODO tasks are separate:** They are non-blocking discoveries made during teammate work. They don't auto-execute because they lack proper context/dependencies. User decides priority.

---

## Agent Teams Constraints (CRITICAL)

These constraints come from the Agent Teams architecture. Violating them causes data loss or broken workflows.

1. **No file isolation.** Two teammates editing the same file = overwrites. Builder OWNS all writes. Reviewers/investigators are READ-ONLY.
2. **No session resumption.** `/resume` does NOT restore teammates. See Session Interruption Recovery above.
3. **No nested teams.** Bug Court's post-fix "abbreviated Review Arena" must reuse the existing team, not spawn a new team. Spawn reviewer teammates into the existing team instead.
4. **Lead's history doesn't carry over.** When creating a team, lead's conversation history is NOT available to teammates. All context must be passed via task descriptions, messages, or memory files.
5. **Teammates CAN see CLAUDE.md + project skills.** Unlike CC10x subagents, Agent Teams teammates load CLAUDE.md and project-level skills automatically.
6. **No synchronization primitives.** Pair Build's builder-reviewer sync uses message-based polling, not blocking waits.
7. **Delegate mode is MANDATORY.** Lead must enter delegate mode (Shift+Tab) after team creation to prevent accidentally implementing code.

---

## Gates (Must Pass)

1. **MEMORY_LOADED** - Before routing
2. **TASKS_CHECKED** - Check TaskList() for active workflow
3. **INTENT_CLARIFIED** - User intent is unambiguous (all workflows)
4. **RESEARCH_EXECUTED** - Before planner (if research trigger detected)
5. **RESEARCH_PERSISTED** - Save to docs/research/ + update activeContext.md (if research was executed)
6. **REQUIREMENTS_CLARIFIED** - Before invoking teammates (BUILD only)
7. **TASKS_CREATED** - Workflow task hierarchy created
8. **TEAM_CREATED** - Agent Team spawned for workflow
9. **ALL_TASKS_COMPLETED** - All tasks (including Memory Update) status="completed"
10. **CONTRACTS_VALIDATED** - All Router Contracts parsed and validated
11. **MEMORY_UPDATED** - Before marking done

---

## Team Shutdown

After workflow completes:
1. Send shutdown_request to all teammates
2. Wait for shutdown approvals
3. Clean up team: `TeamDelete()`
4. Report results to user

---

## Key Rules

1. **Lead NEVER implements code** - delegate mode always
2. **Every teammate outputs a Router Contract** - YAML at end of output
3. **Every workflow reads memory first** - `.claude/cc100x/`
4. **Teammates own file sets** - no two teammates edit the same file
5. **READ-ONLY agents** include Memory Notes for lead to persist
6. **WRITE agents** update memory directly
7. **Wait for teammates** - never implement while teammates are working
8. **All skill references** use `cc100x:` prefix
9. **No nested teams** - reuse existing team for sub-workflows
10. **Memory anchor integrity** - never rename section headers used as Edit anchors
