## Source of Truth

- `plugins/cc100x/skills`
- `plugins/cc100x/agents`

No other location defines runtime behavior.

## Orchestration Entry and Routing

- Single entry orchestrator is `cc100x-lead`.
- Routing priority is strict: ERROR > PLAN > REVIEW > BUILD.
- ERROR always wins ambiguity.

## Workflow Canon (SDLC as One System)

- BUILD: Pair Build (builder + live-reviewer) -> hunter -> triad review + challenge -> verifier.
- DEBUG: Bug Court (2-5 investigators) -> debate -> builder fix -> triad review + challenge -> verifier.
- REVIEW: triad review + challenge round.
- PLAN: single planner in plan approval mode.

## Agent Teams Preflight Canon

Before execution/resume:

- Agent Teams must be enabled.
- Only one active team is allowed per session.
- Team naming is deterministic.
- Lead must switch to delegate mode after team creation.
- `TEAM_CREATED` is an operational gate: `TeamCreate(...)` + teammate reachability via direct `SendMessage(...)` before any assignment.
- Teammates are activated by phase (lazy spawn), not pre-spawned all at kickoff.
- Default memory owner is lead (`MEMORY_OWNER: lead`).

## Task DAG and Completion Canon

- Workflows are task-graph enforced via `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`.
- Workflow task hierarchy is created in the team-scoped task list after team creation.
- BUILD topology is guarded: required tasks/blockers are validated pre-execution and pre-verifier.
- No direct shortcut from hunter/remediation to verifier.
- Memory Update task is mandatory in BUILD/DEBUG/REVIEW/PLAN.
- Workflow completion requires all tasks complete, including Memory Update and successful TEAM_SHUTDOWN.

## Router Contract and Remediation Canon

- Lead validates every teammate via Router Contract before task completion.
- Blocking/remediation fields create remediation pathing.
- Remediation naming is canonicalized to `CC100X REM-FIX:` (legacy `CC100X REMEDIATION:` is compatibility-only).
- Circuit breaker applies before repeated REM-FIX loops.
- Remediation re-enters re-review + re-hunt before verifier.

## Role and Write Ownership Canon

- Builder is the only source-writer in BUILD implementation flow.
- Investigator is read-only during hypothesis phase.
- Reviewers/hunter/verifier/live-reviewer are read-only.
- Planner writes plan files; memory persistence is lead-owned by default.
- Read-only review agents are capability-constrained and must not generate ad-hoc report artifacts.

## Artifact Governance Canon

- Teammate outputs are message-first (Router Contract + findings), not root report file generation.
- Durable artifact paths are scoped (`docs/plans/`, `docs/research/`, `docs/reviews/` when explicitly requested).
- Unauthorized artifact claims route to `CC100X REM-EVIDENCE` and block downstream tasks.

## Memory Ownership Canon

- Lead owns memory persistence by default in team workflows.
- Teammates emit Memory Notes; lead persists in workflow-final memory task.
- Teammate memory edits are explicit exception only (`MEMORY_OWNER: teammate`).

## Agent-Team Collaboration Canon

- Reviewer/investigator debate phases require direct teammate messaging.
- Required messaging agents have `SendMessage` tool access.
- Parallel phases are followed by lead-level result collection and synthesis.

## Constraints and Operations Canon

- No session resumption of teammates.
- No nested teams.
- One team per session.
- Lead is fixed for team lifetime.
- Permission inheritance occurs at spawn.
- Broadcast is restricted (targeted messaging preferred).
- Team shutdown must end with `TeamDelete()`.
- If `TeamDelete()` fails, cleanup is retried and workflow remains open.
- Idle/task status lag follows deterministic escalation (nudge -> status request -> reassignment).
- Lead updates are state-change-driven (no repetitive idle heartbeat narration).

## Hooks and Self-Claim Policy Canon

- Hooks are optional and disabled-by-default for core runtime correctness.
- Self-claim is explicit opt-in and not default in role-specialized BUILD/DEBUG flows.
