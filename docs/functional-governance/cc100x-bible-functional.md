# CC100x Bible (Functional-Derived)

Status: canonical-functional
Audience: maintainers, auditors, improvement workflows
Rule: every normative statement must cite a functional source

## Scope

CC100x runtime truth is defined only by:

- `plugins/cc100x/skills`
- `plugins/cc100x/agents`

Source: `plugins/cc100x/skills/cc100x-lead/SKILL.md:4`

## 1) Entry and Deterministic Routing

CC100x has one orchestration entrypoint (`cc100x-lead`) with strict routing:

- ERROR routes to DEBUG and has highest priority.
- PLAN, REVIEW, and BUILD follow in that order.
- Ambiguity resolution is explicit: ERROR wins.

## 2) SDLC as One Connected System

The lifecycle is integrated and task-enforced:

- BUILD: Pair Build -> Hunter -> triad review + challenge -> Verifier.
- DEBUG: 2-5 investigators -> debate -> builder fix -> triad review + challenge -> Verifier.
- REVIEW: triad review + challenge round.
- PLAN: planner in plan approval mode with lead handshake.

## 3) Agent Teams Preflight Is Mandatory

Before team execution or resume:

- Agent Teams must be enabled.
- Session must not keep stale active team state.
- Team naming is deterministic.
- Lead enters delegate mode before assignment.
- `TEAM_CREATED` is an operational gate (not narrative): team exists, required teammates are spawned, direct messaging is reachable.
- Teammate prompts declare default memory owner as lead.

## 4) Task Graph and Memory-Update Closure

Workflow execution is DAG-first and closure-gated:

- Workflow tasks are explicitly created and dependency-gated.
- Workflow task hierarchy is created in the team-scoped task list after `TeamCreate`.
- BUILD structural integrity is enforced (required tasks and blockers).
- Verifier cannot bypass challenge (no hunter/remediation direct unlock).
- Every workflow includes a `CC100X Memory Update` task.
- Workflow cannot complete until Memory Update and TEAM_SHUTDOWN both succeed.

## 5) Router Contract Is Non-Negotiable

Every teammate must emit machine-readable Router Contract YAML. Lead validates contract before completion and routes remediation for blocking outcomes.

Source: `plugins/cc100x/skills/cc100x-lead/SKILL.md:710`

## 6) Remediation and Re-Review Loop Integrity

Blocking findings trigger remediation tasks, and remediation must pass re-review + re-hunt before verifier is allowed to close.

Canonical remediation naming is `CC100X REM-FIX:`; legacy `CC100X REMEDIATION:` is accepted only for backward compatibility.

## 7) Role Ownership and File Safety

Write/read boundaries are explicit:

- Builder owns implementation writes.
- Planner writes plan files; memory persistence remains lead-owned by default.
- Investigator is read-only in hypothesis stage.
- Reviewers/hunter/verifier/live-reviewer are read-only.

## 8) Memory Ownership Canon (Lead by Default)

Memory persistence is owner-scoped:

- Lead owns memory persistence in team workflows by default.
- Teammates emit Memory Notes for workflow-final persistence.
- Teammate direct memory edits require explicit override (`MEMORY_OWNER: teammate`).

## 9) Agent Teams Constraint Canon

Operational constraints are explicit:

- No teammate session restoration via `/resume`.
- No nested teams.
- One active team per session.
- Lead identity is fixed for team lifetime.
- Teammate permissions inherit from lead at spawn.
- Broadcast is limited in favor of targeted messaging.
- Shutdown requires approval flow and team deletion.
- Failed `TeamDelete()` is retried; workflow is not finalized until cleanup succeeds.

## 10) Hooks and Self-Claim Policy

- Hooks are optional and disabled-by-default for core correctness.
- Self-claim is explicit opt-in and disabled by default for role-specialized flows.

## 11) Release Gates

A workflow is complete only when mandatory gates pass, including:

- `AGENT_TEAMS_READY`
- `CONTRACTS_VALIDATED`
- `ALL_TASKS_COMPLETED`
- `MEMORY_UPDATED`
- `TEAM_SHUTDOWN`

## 12) Documentation Governance Rule

If any non-functional doc conflicts with runtime files, functional files win.
