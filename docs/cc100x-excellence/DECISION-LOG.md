# CC100x Excellence Decision Log

## Purpose
Maintain an auditable record of all quality-impacting decisions across Phases A-E.

No major orchestration change should be considered final without a decision entry.

## Decision Rules
1. Every phase start and completion requires an entry.
2. Every hard-gate exception requires explicit rationale and owner signoff.
3. Every rejected proposal remains documented (for future context).
4. Release eligibility requires all required phase decisions marked `APPROVED`.

## Status Values
- `APPROVED`
- `REJECTED`
- `HOLD`
- `SUPERSEDED`

## Active Decisions

## DEC-20260209-001
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-09
- **Phase:** A
- **Title:** Start CC100x Excellence Program with quality-only scope
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/*`
- **Context:** Need compaction-safe program before runtime upgrades.
- **Decision:** Approve Phase A artifact creation first, no runtime behavior changes.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Immediate runtime edits; rejected to reduce early orchestration risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove Phase A docs if superseded by new planning framework.
- **Evidence:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`
- **Follow-ups:** Create KPI scorecard, benchmark cases, and keep this log updated.

## DEC-20260209-002
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-09
- **Phase:** A
- **Title:** Keep hooks disabled-by-default policy
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** runtime governance policy
- **Context:** Historical hook instability risk in CC10x context.
- **Decision:** Do not require runtime hooks for CC100x core orchestration.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Blocking hook gates for task completion; rejected for current pre-prod baseline.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Revisit as optional enterprise extension after stable production.
- **Evidence:** Program invariants in `MASTER-PLAN.md`.
- **Follow-ups:** Ensure all upcoming designs keep hook dependency optional.

## DEC-20260210-001
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Phase:** D
- **Title:** Implement deterministic benchmark harness and protocol-integrity lint
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `scripts/eval/*`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`, `package.json`, excellence docs
- **Context:** Phase D required reproducible scoring artifacts and stronger protocol regression checks before prod merge.
- **Decision:** Implement benchmark scaffold and score scripts, add protocol-integrity lint, and wire all checks under `npm run check:cc100x`.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Manual retrospective-only validation; rejected because it is hard to reproduce and compare across runs.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove added scripts and script entries; retain existing runtime orchestration unchanged.
- **Evidence:** `scripts/eval/run-benchmark.sh`, `scripts/eval/score-benchmark.sh`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`, `package.json`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute deterministic benchmark runs, produce `summary.json` and `scorecard.json`, then complete Phase D gate evidence.

## DEC-20260210-002
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Phase:** D
- **Title:** Approve borrow strategy with harmony-first fit rules
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/BORROW-STRATEGY-NEURAL-HARMONY.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`
- **Context:** Need a single strategy for integrating external ideas (Gastown, Superpowers, GSD, BMAD, Agent-OS concepts) without introducing orchestration chaos.
- **Decision:** Adopt a phased S1-S4 borrow strategy with strict fit filters, no mandatory hooks, no default role expansion, and a final completeness gate.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Ad-hoc per-file borrowing; rejected due to high conflict/redundancy risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove strategy references from master plan and continue deterministic baseline only.
- **Evidence:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/BORROW-STRATEGY-NEURAL-HARMONY.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute S1 first, validate with `npm run check:cc100x`, then progress sequentially.

## DEC-20260210-003
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Phase:** B
- **Title:** Execute S1 state vocabulary and severity escalation normalization
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `plugins/cc100x/skills/cc100x-lead/SKILL.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/EXPECTED-BEHAVIOR-RUNBOOK.md`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`
- **Context:** Live retros showed ambiguity around idle vs progress signals and inconsistent escalation semantics.
- **Decision:** Add normalized runtime states (`working`, `idle-blocked`, `idle-unresponsive`, `stalled`, `done`) and enforce deterministic LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL escalation actions.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Keep time-based nudges only; rejected due to repeated ambiguity and weak failure semantics.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove S1 sections from lead/runbook/lint and revert to prior idle ladder semantics.
- **Evidence:** Updated S1 runtime and validation docs + successful `npm run check:cc100x`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute S2 handoff/resume integrity with the same pattern (runtime + runbook + lint + decision entry).

## DEC-20260210-004
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Phase:** B
- **Title:** Execute S2 session handoff + resume integrity hardening
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `plugins/cc100x/skills/cc100x-lead/SKILL.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/EXPECTED-BEHAVIOR-RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/BENCHMARK-CASES.md`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`
- **Context:** Live runs showed interruption ambiguity, teammate-loss confusion after `/resume`, and weak continuity evidence at compaction boundaries.
- **Decision:** Make handoff payload schema mandatory, enforce deterministic resume checklist, extend interruption benchmark scenarios, and lock requirements in protocol lint.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Keep interruption handling as advisory text only; rejected due to repeated nondeterministic recovery behavior.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert S2 sections in lead/runbook/benchmark/lint and return to pre-S2 recovery semantics.
- **Evidence:** S2 runtime + runbook + benchmark + lint updates and successful `npm run check:cc100x`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute S3 adaptive depth (quick vs full) with deterministic gate compatibility.

## DEC-20260211-001
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Phase:** E
- **Title:** Establish explicit production readiness finish line and anti-overengineering stop rule
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/PRODUCTION-READINESS-SYSTEM.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`
- **Context:** Pre-production improvements can become endless without objective release criteria, leading to complexity drift and delayed shipment.
- **Decision:** Define hard production gates (PR1-PR5), a release decision matrix, and a stop-innovation rule to determine when to ship and when to freeze architecture.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Keep release timing as subjective judgment; rejected due to repeated loop risk and over-engineering pressure.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove production readiness system doc and revert master plan references; return to prior phase-only governance.
- **Evidence:** New production readiness framework file + updated master plan action list.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute S3/S4, run full live validation matrix, then record explicit `READY NOW` / `READY WITH DECLARED LIMITS` / `NOT READY` decision.

## DEC-20260211-002
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Phase:** B
- **Title:** Execute S3 adaptive depth selector (quick vs full) with safety-first escalation
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `plugins/cc100x/skills/cc100x-lead/SKILL.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/EXPECTED-BEHAVIOR-RUNBOOK.md`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`
- **Context:** Need higher throughput for bounded low-risk BUILD work while preventing over-engineering and preserving CC100x quality guarantees.
- **Decision:** Introduce deterministic depth selector where QUICK is allowed only for bounded low-risk BUILD scope, FULL remains default, and QUICK auto-escalates to FULL on any blocking/remediation signal.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Always FULL path only; rejected due to unnecessary orchestration overhead on small safe changes.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove execution-depth selector and QUICK path references from lead/runbook/lint; revert BUILD flow to FULL-only chain.
- **Evidence:** S3 runtime + runbook + lint + plan updates and successful `npm run check:cc100x`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute S4 completeness validation and record final production verdict via production readiness matrix.

## DEC-20260211-003
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Phase:** D
- **Title:** Execute S4 completeness validation gate (Harmony Report + cross-file consistency lint)
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/EXPECTED-BEHAVIOR-RUNBOOK.md`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`
- **Context:** Need objective proof of no conflict/duplication/redundancy before final production verdict.
- **Decision:** Add a runbook-level Harmony Report completeness gate and enforce consistency checks in lint for gate ordering, state vocabulary, and remediation-route resolvability.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Keep completeness checks as manual reviewer judgment; rejected due to drift risk and non-repeatable release decisions.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove Harmony Report section and revert added lint checks; return to prior protocol-integrity scope.
- **Evidence:** S4 runbook/lint updates and successful `npm run check:cc100x`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute final live validation matrix and record explicit Phase E release verdict.

## DEC-20260211-004
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Phase:** B
- **Title:** Add runnable-evidence gate to prevent premature remediation from non-runnable teammate output
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `plugins/cc100x/skills/cc100x-lead/SKILL.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/EXPECTED-BEHAVIOR-RUNBOOK.md`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`
- **Context:** Live runs can emit early verifier/reviewer findings before their tasks are runnable, causing noisy or out-of-order remediation paths.
- **Decision:** Only runnable/in-progress task outputs may drive gate transitions. Non-runnable teammate findings are advisory pre-checks and cannot open remediation by default (except immediate safety-critical risks).
- **Alternatives Considered:** Keep current behavior and rely on lead judgment per run; rejected due to recurring false starts and orchestration drift risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove runnable-evidence gate section and associated runbook/lint checks.
- **Evidence:** Lead protocol update + runbook S18 scenario + lint enforcement + successful `npm run check:cc100x`.
- **Follow-ups:** Validate S18 in live run and include result in final Phase E verdict.
