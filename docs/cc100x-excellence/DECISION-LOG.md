# CC100x Excellence Decision Log

## Purpose
Maintain an auditable record of all quality-impacting decisions across Phases A-E.

No major orchestration change should be considered final without a decision entry.

## Decision Rules
1. Every phase start and completion requires an entry.
2. Every hard-gate exception requires explicit rationale and owner signoff.
3. Every rejected proposal remains documented (for future context).
4. Release eligibility requires all required phase decisions marked `APPROVED`.

## Status Values
- `APPROVED`
- `REJECTED`
- `HOLD`
- `SUPERSEDED`

## Phase Gate Checklist

## Phase A Gate (Design Freeze)
1. KPI scorecard approved.
2. Benchmark corpus approved.
3. Decision rules accepted.

## Phase B Gate (Lead Intelligence)
1. `deterministic` behavior parity preserved.
2. `adaptive` and `turbo-quality` rules reviewed.
3. No DAG deadlock risk introduced by design.

## Phase C Gate (Contract + Protocol Hardening)
1. Router Contract v2 is backward-compatible initially.
2. Review/Debug challenge hardening approved.
3. No mandatory hook dependency introduced.

## Phase D Gate (Validation Lab)
1. Full benchmark corpus executed for CC10x baseline and CC100x candidate.
2. KPI scorecards generated and archived.
3. Hard gates pass requirements met.

## Phase E Gate (Promotion)
1. Three consecutive hard-gate passes.
2. Recovery and orchestration reliability validated.
3. Release approval explicitly recorded.

## Active Decisions

## DEC-20260209-001
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-09
- **Phase:** A
- **Title:** Start CC100x Excellence Program with quality-only scope
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/*`
- **Context:** Need compaction-safe program before runtime upgrades.
- **Decision:** Approve Phase A artifact creation first, no runtime behavior changes.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Immediate runtime edits; rejected to reduce early orchestration risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove Phase A docs if superseded by new planning framework.
- **Evidence:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`
- **Follow-ups:** Create KPI scorecard, benchmark cases, and keep this log updated.

## DEC-20260209-002
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-09
- **Phase:** A
- **Title:** Keep hooks disabled-by-default policy
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** runtime governance policy
- **Context:** Historical hook instability risk in CC10x context.
- **Decision:** Do not require runtime hooks for CC100x core orchestration.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Blocking hook gates for task completion; rejected for current pre-prod baseline.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Revisit as optional enterprise extension after stable production.
- **Evidence:** Program invariants in `MASTER-PLAN.md`.
- **Follow-ups:** Ensure all upcoming designs keep hook dependency optional.

## DEC-20260210-001
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Phase:** D
- **Title:** Implement deterministic benchmark harness and protocol-integrity lint
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `scripts/eval/*`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`, `package.json`, excellence docs
- **Context:** Phase D required reproducible scoring artifacts and stronger protocol regression checks before prod merge.
- **Decision:** Implement benchmark scaffold and score scripts, add protocol-integrity lint, and wire all checks under `npm run check:cc100x`.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Manual retrospective-only validation; rejected because it is hard to reproduce and compare across runs.
- **Risk Assessment:** Low
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove added scripts and script entries; retain existing runtime orchestration unchanged.
- **Evidence:** `scripts/eval/run-benchmark.sh`, `scripts/eval/score-benchmark.sh`, `scripts/lint-cc100x-protocol-integrity.sh`, `package.json`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute deterministic benchmark runs, produce `summary.json` and `scorecard.json`, then complete Phase D gate evidence.

## DEC-20260210-002
- **Status:** APPROVED
- **Date:** 2026-02-10
- **Phase:** D
- **Title:** Approve borrow strategy with harmony-first fit rules
- **Owner:** @rom.iluz
- **Scope:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/BORROW-STRATEGY-NEURAL-HARMONY.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`
- **Context:** Need a single strategy for integrating external ideas (Gastown, Superpowers, GSD, BMAD, Agent-OS concepts) without introducing orchestration chaos.
- **Decision:** Adopt a phased S1-S4 borrow strategy with strict fit filters, no mandatory hooks, no default role expansion, and a final completeness gate.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Ad-hoc per-file borrowing; rejected due to high conflict/redundancy risk.
- **Risk Assessment:** Medium
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove strategy references from master plan and continue deterministic baseline only.
- **Evidence:** `docs/cc100x-excellence/BORROW-STRATEGY-NEURAL-HARMONY.md`, `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md`.
- **Follow-ups:** Execute S1 first, validate with `npm run check:cc100x`, then progress sequentially.

## Pending Decisions
1. DEC-Phase-B profile semantics finalization (`deterministic/adaptive/turbo-quality`).
2. DEC-Phase-C Router Contract v2 field set and strictness strategy.
3. DEC-Phase-D KPI threshold lock after first benchmark run execution.
4. DEC-Phase-E production release decision.

## Decision Hygiene Checklist
1. Link each decision to exact files touched.
2. Include measurable acceptance criteria.
3. Include rollback path before approval.
4. Mark superseded decisions to preserve context.
