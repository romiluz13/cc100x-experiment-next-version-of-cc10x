# CC100x Excellence Program (Pre-Production)

## 0) Purpose
Create a **best-in-class** CC100x before first production release by upgrading orchestration quality while preserving CC10x core DNA.

This plan is **compaction-safe** and should be treated as the single source of truth for pre-prod improvements.

---

## 1) Current State Snapshot
- CC10x is production-proven.
- CC100x is functionally refactored for Agent Teams and not yet in production.
- Runtime hooks are **not enabled** and remain optional.
- Current functional runtime files:
  - `plugins/cc100x/skills/*`
  - `plugins/cc100x/agents/*`
- Phase A docs are complete (`KPI-SCORECARD`, `BENCHMARK-CASES`, `DECISION-LOG`).
- Phase B/C runtime hardening is implemented for deterministic orchestration.
- Phase D benchmark harness scripts are implemented (`scripts/eval/run-benchmark.sh`, `scripts/eval/score-benchmark.sh`).

---

## 2) Non-Negotiable Invariants
1. **Do not deprecate CC10x logic.** Upgrade, do not replace.
2. **Agent Teams is the architecture oracle** (lead + teammates + shared tasks + messaging).
3. **Router remains the only entry point** (`cc100x-lead`).
4. **No hooks by default** in core runtime.
5. **Evidence before claims** remains mandatory.
6. **Memory protocol remains mandatory** and compaction-safe.
7. **No destructive cleanup** of legacy assets; archive only.

---

## 3) What We Borrow vs What We Reject
### Borrow (principles only)
- From Superpowers and GSD: sharper task granularity, stronger checkpointing, explicit review gates, concise prompt contracts.

### Reject
- Blind architecture copying.
- Replacing Agent Teams with subagent-centric assumptions.
- Massive new agent explosion without benchmark proof.

---

## 4) Scope Boundaries
## In Scope
- Orchestration quality upgrades.
- Better adaptive parallelization.
- Stronger contract/evidence model.
- Better validation, simulation, and release governance.

## Out of Scope (for now)
- Cost optimization efforts.
- Runtime hooks rollout.
- Large new agent taxonomy unless benchmark proves necessity.

   - `eval:run`
   - `eval:score`
   - `check:protocol-integrity`

---

## 6) Upgrade Architecture (No New Agents Initially)
## 6.1 Lead Execution Profiles
Add profile selection in `cc100x-lead`:
- `deterministic` (default safety)
- `adaptive` (risk/complexity-aware parallelism)
- `turbo-quality` (aggressive parallelism with stricter evidence checks)

## 6.2 Adaptive Parallelization Rules
Lead decides parallel fan-out by:
- file overlap risk
- dependency depth
- ambiguity level
- severity/risk class

## 6.3 Router Contract v2 (Backward-Compatible First)
Introduce stronger evidence fields (accepted but not required initially), e.g.:
- `EVIDENCE_COVERAGE`
- `CLAIMS_WITH_PROOF`
- `UNRESOLVED_CONFLICTS`
- `ASSUMPTION_RISK`

## 6.4 Challenge Round Hardening
Review Arena and Bug Court require explicit conflict resolution table before proceeding.

## 6.5 Pair Build Gate Upgrades
Risk-based post-build gate depth, while preserving current quality chain.

---

## 7) Phased Delivery Plan
## Phase A — Design Freeze & Scoring (Docs only)
Deliver:
- KPI definitions
- benchmark corpus format
- release gates

Changes:
- create `KPI-SCORECARD.md`
- create `BENCHMARK-CASES.md`
- create `DECISION-LOG.md`

Exit Criteria:
- KPI thresholds approved
- benchmark case template approved

## Phase B — Lead Intelligence + Task Graph Hardening (Implemented for deterministic path)
Deliver:
- deterministic orchestration hardening
- strict task state/ownership semantics

Primary file:
- `plugins/cc100x/skills/cc100x-lead/SKILL.md`

Exit Criteria:
- deterministic behavior remains stable
- task DAG safety and recovery semantics are explicit
- profile extensions (`adaptive`, `turbo-quality`) remain roadmap-only

## Phase C — Contract & Protocol Hardening (Implemented)
Deliver:
- Router Contract v2 (soft rollout)
- hardened challenge behavior in Review Arena + Bug Court + Pair Build

Primary files:
- `plugins/cc100x/skills/router-contract/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/cc100x/skills/review-arena/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/cc100x/skills/bug-court/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/cc100x/skills/pair-build/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/cc100x/agents/*.md` (contract output sections)

Exit Criteria:
- lead accepts both v1 and v2 contract fields
- no flow deadlocks introduced

## Phase D — Validation Lab
Deliver:
- benchmark scripts and baseline runs CC10x vs CC100x
- deterministic replay of failure scenarios

Files:
- `scripts/eval/run-benchmark.sh`
- `scripts/eval/score-benchmark.sh`
- `package.json`

Exit Criteria:
- reproducible score reports
- no critical regression vs CC10x baseline
- decision log updated with benchmark evidence

## Phase E — Promotion Gate
Deliver:
- go/no-go decision from KPI outcomes
- final doc updates in decision log

Exit Criteria:
- all hard quality gates pass

---

## 8) Risk Matrix
## Low Risk
- documentation and scorecards
- benchmark harness scripts
- additive profile docs

## Medium Risk
- adaptive routing logic in lead
- stricter challenge round protocol

## High Risk
- making v2 contract fields hard-required too early
- introducing many new agents without evidence
- enabling runtime blocking hooks

Risk Controls:
1. backward-compatible contract rollout
2. profile-gated rollout (`deterministic` default)
3. benchmark gate before strict enforcement
4. no hooks default preserved

---

## 9) Validation & Acceptance Gates
## Gate G1 — Functional Safety
- all existing workflows still executable in `deterministic`
- no orphan or deadlocked task states

## Gate G2 — Quality Evidence
- review precision improves or stays equal
- debug root-cause accuracy improves
- verifier pass quality improves

## Gate G3 — Recovery Robustness
- session interruption recovery works under active workflows
- memory consistency preserved after compaction-like scenarios

## Gate G4 — Release Governance
- scorecard thresholds met
- decision log contains explicit approval

---

## 10) Rollout Strategy
1. Implement additive changes first.
2. Keep `deterministic` as default.
3. Run benchmark suite.
4. Only then promote stricter profile behavior.
5. Keep fallback path documented (`deterministic` + v1 contract acceptance).

---

## 11) What “Best-in-Class” Means Here
CC100x can be called best-in-class only if:
1. It preserves CC10x core reliability.
2. It leverages Agent Teams better than static orchestration.
3. It proves gains via repeatable benchmark outcomes.
4. It remains human-trustworthy through strict evidence contracts.

---

## 12) Next Action List (Immediate)
1. Execute deterministic benchmark corpus and persist artifacts in `artifacts/eval/<run-id>/deterministic/`.
2. Score run with `scripts/eval/score-benchmark.sh` and review hard-gate pass/fail.
3. Update decision log with Phase D evidence and release recommendation.
4. Reassess whether additional execution profiles are needed after deterministic benchmark results.

---

## 13) Compaction Resume Prompt
If chat compacts, resume with:

"Use `docs/cc100x-excellence/MASTER-PLAN.md` as the single source of truth. Phase A/B/C are complete and Phase D harness is implemented; execute deterministic benchmark runs, score them, and update the decision log with evidence."
