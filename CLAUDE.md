# CC100x - Next-Gen Orchestration on Agent Teams

## What This Is

CC100x is an experimental Claude Code plugin that builds orchestration **entirely on Agent Teams**. It evolves from CC10x (production) but is a separate, standalone project. It uses peer-to-peer teammate messaging, adversarial review, competing hypothesis debugging, and real-time pair programming.

**DO NOT touch or read from CC10x production files.** Everything you need is in this folder.

## How To Build

**Follow the plan exactly. Phase by phase. Do not skip. Do not reorder.**

### Step 1: Read the architecture
Read `docs/cc100x-bible.md` - this is the source of truth for what CC100x is.

### Step 2: Follow the build plan
Read `docs/BUILD-PLAN.md` - this is the A-to-Z build plan with 11 phases.

### Step 3: Read reference material AS NEEDED
Each phase in BUILD-PLAN.md tells you which reference files to read before writing. All CC10x reference material is organized in `reference/`:

### Reference: Agent Teams (the foundation)
| File | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `reference/agent-teams-complete-docs.md` | **Complete Agent Teams documentation** (architecture, messaging, tasks, limitations) |
| `reference/anthropic-2026-features-research.md` | Anthropic 2026 features research (Agent Teams, Opus 4.6, etc.) |

### Reference: CC10x Architecture (what we evolved from)
| File | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `reference/cc10x-orchestration-bible.md` | CC10x architecture (Router Contract, memory protocol, decision tree) |
| `reference/cc10x-orchestration-logic-analysis.md` | CC10x orchestration logic deep analysis |
| `reference/cc10x-router-SKILL.md` | CC10x router skill (decision tree, task orchestration - reference for cc100x-lead) |

| `reference/cc10x-agents/planner.md` | CC10x planner agent (port to cc100x planner) |

### Reference: CC10x Skills (port/evolve these to CC100x)
| File | Contains |

| `reference/cc10x-skills/session-memory.md` | Memory protocol (port to cc100x) |
| `reference/cc10x-skills/verification-before-completion.md` | Verification gates (port to cc100x) |

### Reference: CC10x Plugin Structure (copy this structure for CC100x)
| File | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `reference/cc10x-plugin-structure/plugin.json` | Plugin manifest (copy and modify for cc100x) |
| `reference/cc10x-plugin-structure/marketplace.json` | Marketplace config (copy and modify for cc100x) |
| `reference/cc10x-plugin-structure/CLAUDE.md` | CC10x user-facing CLAUDE.md (reference for cc100x version) |

## Key Rules

1. **Every agent outputs a Router Contract** (YAML at end of output)
2. **Every agent reads memory first** (`.claude/cc100x/`)
3. **Lead always uses delegate mode** (never implements code)
4. **Teammates own file sets** (no two teammates edit the same file)
5. **READ-ONLY agents** (reviewers, hunter, verifier) include Memory Notes for lead to persist
6. **WRITE agents** (builder, investigator, planner) update memory directly
7. **Agent Teams convention**: use `agents/` folder (not `teammates/`) per Claude Code plugin spec
8. **All skill references**: use `cc100x:` prefix (not `cc10x:`)

---

## Agent Teams Requirement

CC100x requires Agent Teams to be enabled:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```
This should already be set in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
