## What Makes CC100x Different From CC10x

CC10x uses **sequential agent delegation** - one agent at a time, orchestrated by the router.

CC100x uses **Agent Teams** - real teammates that message each other, debate, and work in parallel:

| Feature | CC10x | CC100x |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Code Review** | Single reviewer | **3 reviewers** (security + performance + quality) who **challenge each other** |
| **Debugging** | Single investigator | **Multiple investigators** each championing a different hypothesis, then **debating** |
| **Building** | Builder then reviewer | Builder and reviewer work **simultaneously** - real-time pair programming |
| **Communication** | Router passes results between agents | Agents **message each other directly** |
| **Architecture** | Hub and spoke | **Peer-to-peer mesh** |

---

## How It Works

```
YOU: "build a user auth system"

## The 4 Workflows

| Intent | Trigger Words | What Happens |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **BUILD** | build, implement, create, make | **Pair Build**: Builder + Live Reviewer, then Hunter, Review Arena (triad + challenge), then Verifier |
| **DEBUG** | debug, fix, error, bug, broken | **Bug Court**: Multiple investigators compete with hypotheses, then debate |
| **REVIEW** | review, audit, check, analyze | **Review Arena**: 3 specialized reviewers challenge each other's findings |
| **PLAN** | plan, design, architect, roadmap | Single planner in Plan Approval Mode |

---

## The 3 Protocols

### Review Arena (REVIEW)

Three reviewers independently analyze your code, then cross-examine each other:

```
Security Reviewer: "Found XSS vulnerability at line 45"
Performance Reviewer: "The fix for that XSS would create an N+1 query"
Quality Reviewer: "Here's a pattern that solves both - extract to middleware"
```

**Conflict resolution:** Security concerns always win. Majority rules otherwise.

### Bug Court (DEBUG)

Multiple investigators each champion a different hypothesis, gather evidence, then debate:

```
Investigator 1: "Race condition in auth middleware" (evidence: timing logs)
Investigator 2: "Stale cache after deploy" (evidence: cache timestamps)
Investigator 3: "Your theory doesn't explain intermittent failures"
Investigator 1: "Look at my test - concurrent requests reproduce it every time"
```

**Verdict:** Strongest evidence + survived cross-examination wins.

### Pair Build (BUILD)

Builder and reviewer work simultaneously with real-time messaging:

```
Builder: "Review src/auth/middleware.ts"
Reviewer: "LGTM - JWT validation looks correct"
Builder: "Review src/auth/session.ts"
Reviewer: "STOP - token stored in localStorage. Use httpOnly cookie."
Builder: "Fixed. Re-review?"
Reviewer: "LGTM"
```

## What Makes CC100x TRULY 100x (Not Just Renamed CC10x)

CC100x isn't just CC10x with Agent Teams bolted on. It's architecturally different:

| Dimension | CC10x (Sequential) | CC100x (Agent Teams) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Review quality** | 1 reviewer sees everything | 3 specialists see what others miss, then **cross-examine** |
| **Debug speed** | 1 hypothesis at a time, try → fail → next | 3+ hypotheses **in parallel**, strongest evidence wins |
| **Build safety** | Build → review (reviewer sees cold code) | Build + review **simultaneously** (reviewer sees hot code) |
| **Error handling** | Hunter finds issues, builder may miss context | Hunter + Verifier + Remediation Loop (task-enforced) |
| **Memory** | Session memory survives context loss | Same + **task-enforced** memory (can't skip Memory Update) |
| **Skill loading** | Frontmatter injection (auto) | SKILL_HINTS (lead detects workflow, passes domain skills) |
| **Research** | Lead does research inline | Full tiered research chain with checkpoints + persistence |
| **Conflict resolution** | Router decides | **Agents debate**, lead arbitrates with evidence |
| **Communication** | Hub-spoke (router relays) | **Peer-to-peer mesh** (agents message each other directly) |

**The fundamental shift:** CC10x = one brain orchestrating one agent at a time. CC100x = one coordinator managing a team of specialists who challenge each other.

---

## Memory Persistence

CC100x survives context compaction:

```
.claude/cc100x/
├── activeContext.md   # Current focus, decisions, learnings
├── patterns.md        # Project conventions, common gotchas
└── progress.md        # Completed work, verification evidence
```

**Iron Law:** Every workflow loads memory at START and persists at END (lead-owned Memory Update task by default).

---

## Quality Validation Harness (Phase D)

CC100x now includes reproducible benchmark scaffolding for pre-prod promotion gates.

```bash
# Run static protocol checks
npm run check:cc100x

# Create a benchmark run scaffold
npm run eval:run -- --candidate cc100x --profile deterministic

# Score a filled run scaffold
npm run eval:score -- --run-dir artifacts/eval/<run-id>/deterministic
```

Generated benchmark artifacts:
- `artifacts/eval/<run-id>/<profile>/summary-input.json`
- `artifacts/eval/<run-id>/<profile>/case-results.jsonl`
- `artifacts/eval/<run-id>/<profile>/summary.json`
- `artifacts/eval/<run-id>/<profile>/scorecard.json`

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add romiluz13/cc100x-experiment-next-version-of-cc10x
/plugin install cc100x-experiment-next-version-of-cc10x@romiluz13
```

### Step 2: Enable Agent Teams

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Activate

Copy this README, paste it into Claude Code, and say: **"Set up cc100x for me"**

### Step 4: Restart Claude Code

---

## For Claude Code: Setup Instructions

**When user says "set up cc100x", "install cc100x", or similar:**

### Step 1: Check Existing Files
- Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (may not exist)
- Read `~/.claude/settings.json` (may not exist)

### Step 2: Update `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

**If file doesn't exist:** CREATE with the template below.
**If file exists:** PREPEND the cc100x section below, keep user's existing content.

```markdown
# CC100x Orchestration (Always On)

IMPORTANT: For ANY development task, route through cc100x-lead before making code changes.
IMPORTANT: Read-only exploration is allowed, but invoke the lead before Edit/Write/code-changing Bash.
IMPORTANT: Never bypass the lead. It is the system.
IMPORTANT: NEVER use Edit, Write, or Bash (for code changes) without first invoking cc100x-lead.

**Skip CC100x ONLY when:**
- User EXPLICITLY says "don't use cc100x", "without cc100x", or "skip cc100x"
- No interpretation. No guessing. Only these exact opt-out phrases.

[CC100x]|entry: cc100x:cc100x-lead
```

### Step 3: Update `~/.claude/settings.json`

Ensure Agent Teams is enabled:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

Add permissions:
```json
"Bash(mkdir -p .claude/cc100x)",
"Bash(mkdir -p docs/plans)",
"Bash(mkdir -p docs/research)",
"Bash(git status)",
"Bash(git diff:*)",
"Bash(git log:*)",
"Bash(git branch:*)"
```

### Step 4: Confirm
> "cc100x is set up! Please restart Claude Code to activate."

## Router Contract

Every agent outputs a machine-readable YAML block:

```yaml
STATUS: PASS | FAIL | APPROVE | CHANGES_REQUESTED | ...
CONFIDENCE: [0-100]
CRITICAL_ISSUES: [count]
BLOCKING: [true|false]
REQUIRES_REMEDIATION: [true|false]
MEMORY_NOTES:
  learnings: ["insight"]
  patterns: ["gotcha"]
  verification: ["evidence"]
```

The lead uses these contracts to:
- Validate agent output
- Decide whether to proceed or block
- Resolve conflicts between agents
- Persist memory notes

---

## Safety

For safe modification of CC100x orchestration, use the companion safety skill:

```
/cc100x-orchestration-safety
```

This enforces extreme caution when editing lead, agents, or workflow skills. Available as a user-level skill at `~/.claude/skills/cc100x-orchestration-safety/SKILL.md`.

---

## Evolved From CC10x

CC100x evolves from [CC10x](https://github.com/romiluz13/cc10x) (250+ commits, 12 skills, 6 agents). Everything that worked in CC10x is preserved:

- All 8 orchestration invariants
- Memory protocol (load-first, edit-verify, stable anchors)
- Router Contract format (YAML machine-readable output)
- TDD enforcement (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Research persistence (docs/research/ + memory links)
- Verification gates (evidence before claims)

What's new is the **Agent Teams architecture** that enables parallel work, peer debate, and adversarial review.
